            <h2>Definition:</h2>
            <p>GPS (Global Positioning System) in disaster management refers to the use of satellite-based navigation technology to accurately determine and share geographic coordinates, allowing for the precise tracking and coordination of resources, responders, and information during disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. It plays a crucial role in improving situational awareness, enhancing communication, and facilitating efficient disaster management operation
            </p>
            <h2>
                Cause:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Disasters can be caused by various natural and human-made factors, and the application of GPS technology is relevant in managing a wide range of disasters, including:

 <br>1. Natural Disasters:
    Earthquakes
    <br> Hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones
    <br> Floods
   <br>Wildfires
   <br>Tornadoes
   <br> Tsunamis
   <br> Volcanic eruptions
   <br> Landslides

 <br>2. Human-Made Disasters:
 <br> Industrial accidents (e.g., chemical spills)
 <br> Nuclear accidents
 <br> Terrorism and acts of violence
   <br>Transportation accidents (e.g., plane crashes, train derailments)

<h2>Prevention</h2>

While GPS primarily aids in disaster management and response, prevention is a crucial aspect of disaster management, and GPS technology can indirectly support prevention efforts by improving situational awareness and data collection. Prevention strategies for disasters include:

 <br>1. Risk Assessment: Use GPS data to identify and assess high-risk areas for various types of disasters. This information helps in urban planning and land-use regulations to minimize vulnerabilities.

 <br>2. Early Warning Systems: GPS can be used to monitor real-time data related to seismic activity, weather patterns, and other disaster indicators. Early warning systems can provide alerts to at-risk populations in advance of disasters, giving them time to evacuate or take protective measures.

 <br>3. Infrastructure Planning: GPS technology can assist in planning and constructing resilient infrastructure that can withstand disasters, such as earthquake-resistant buildings or flood-resistant levees.

 <br> 4. Environmental Monitoring: GPS-enabled devices can track environmental changes, including deforestation, temperature variations, and water quality. This data can inform conservation efforts and reduce environmental factors that contribute to disasters.

 <br>5. Community Education and Preparedness: Use GPS data and mapping tools to create public awareness campaigns and educational materials to inform communities about disaster risks and preparedness measures.

 <br>6. Resource Allocation: During disaster response and recovery, GPS helps in efficiently allocating resources like search and rescue teams, medical supplies, and relief supplies to affected areas.

 <br>7. Evacuation Planning: GPS technology can assist in creating evacuation routes and helping people navigate to safety during disasters.
