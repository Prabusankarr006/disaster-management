            <h2>Rockfall :</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Rockfall disasters occur when rocks or debris, ranging from small pebbles to large boulders, detach from a rock face or steep slope and fall to the ground. These incidents can result in property damage, injury, or even loss of life. Understanding the causes and implementing prevention measures are crucial for minimizing the risks associated with rockfalls.</p>
    <h2>Causes :
    </h2>
    <P>
      <br>  1. Geological Factors:
      <br>Geological factors such as the type of rock, its stability, and the presence of geological faults or fractures can influence the likelihood of rockfalls.
      <br>Weathering and erosion processes weaken rocks over time, making them more prone to detachment.

      <br>2. Weather Conditions:
      <br>Heavy rainfall, freeze-thaw cycles, and rapid temperature changes can trigger rockfalls. Water can infiltrate cracks in rocks, leading to increased instability.

      <br>3. Vegetation and Root Growth:
      <br> Plant roots can penetrate and expand cracks in rocks, further destabilizing them. Removal of vegetation can sometimes increase the risk of rockfalls.

    </P>
    <h2>
        Prevention :
    </h2>
    <P>
       <br> 1.Site Assessment and Monitoring:
       <br> Conduct geological assessments to identify areas prone to rockfalls. Regular monitoring can help detect signs of instability.
       <br> Install geotechnical instruments like inclinometers and seismometers to measure ground movement and vibrations.
     
       <br>2. *Vegetation Management:
       <br> Maintain and manage vegetation on slopes. This can include planting deep-rooted vegetation to stabilize soil and rocks.
