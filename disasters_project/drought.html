            <h2>Drought:
            </h2>
            <p>
                A drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low precipitation that leads to water shortages, causing adverse impacts on various aspects of life, including agriculture, water supply, ecosystems, and economies. Droughts can vary in intensity, duration, and geographic extent, and they may occur in different forms, such as meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, or socioeconomic droughts. Each type of drought has its own set of characteristics and impacts.

            </p>
            <h2> Causes:</h2>
            <p><br>1. Lack of Rainfall:A primary natural cause of drought is a prolonged period of below-average precipitation. Climate variability, such as El Niño and La Niña events, can influence rainfall patterns.

                <br> 2. High Temperatures:Elevated temperatures can increase evaporation rates, leading to higher water loss from soil, rivers, and reservoirs, exacerbating drought conditions.
                
                <br> 3. Climate Change: Long-term changes in climate patterns, driven by factors like global warming, can alter rainfall patterns and increase the frequency and severity of droughts.</p>
                <h2>Prevention:</h2>
                <p>
                <br>1.Ecosystem Restoration: Restore and protect natural ecosystems, such as wetlands and forests, to enhance water retention and maintain healthy hydrological cycles.

<br>2.Infrastructure Development:Invest in water storage infrastructure, such as dams and reservoirs, to capture and store water during wet periods for use during dry periods.

<br>3.Education and Awareness: Raise public awareness about water conservation and the importance of using water wisely, both at the individual and community levels.

<br>4.Policy and Governance:Implement policies that promote sustainable water management, allocate water resources fairly, and regulate groundwater extraction.

<br>5.Climate Change Mitigation: Address the root causes of drought by reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change and its impact on precipitation patterns.

<br>6.International Cooperation: Collaborate with neighboring regions and countries to manage shared water resources and coordinate responses to transboundary droughts.
