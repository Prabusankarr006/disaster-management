            <h2>Wildfires :</h2>
            <p>A wildfire, also known as a forest fire, bushfire, or grassfire, is an uncontrolled and rapidly spreading fire that consumes vegetation, such as trees, shrubs, grasses, and other flammable materials, in a natural or urban environment. Wildfires can vary in size and intensity, ranging from small, localized burns to large, devastating infernos that can cover vast areas
            </p>
            <h2>
                Causes :
            </h2>
            <p>
               1. Natural Causes:
                  <br> Lightning: Lightning strikes are a natural source of wildfires when they hit dry vegetation.

               <br>  Volcanic Eruptions:Volcanic eruptions can release hot lava, ash, and embers that can ignite fires.
               <br> Spontaneous Combustion: Certain materials, such as peat, can spontaneously combust under certain conditions, leading to fires.
             
             <br>2. Human Causes:
             <br>   Campfires: Improperly extinguished campfires can spark wildfires.
             <br>  Cigarettes: Discarded cigarette butts can ignite dry vegetation.
             <br>   Arson: Deliberate acts of arson involve intentionally setting fires, which can cause significant damage.
             <br>  Equipment and Machinery: Sparks from equipment, like chainsaws or power lines, can ignite fires.
             <br>   Fireworks: Fireworks can start fires when they fall to the ground or malfunction.
            </p>
            <h2>Prevention :</h2>
            <p>

 <br>1. Fire Bans and Restrictions: Authorities can impose bans on campfires, fireworks, and other outdoor activities during periods of high fire danger.

 <br>2. Vegetation Management: Clearing and thinning of vegetation in vulnerable areas can reduce fuel for wildfires.

 <br>3. Firebreaks:Creating firebreaks or cleared areas devoid of vegetation can slow the progress of wildfires.

            </p>
            <h2>History of Wildfires</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The Great Fire of London (1666): This was not a forest fire but a devastating urban fire that occurred in London, England. It destroyed much of the city, including homes and buildings</li>
            <li>Peshtigo Fire (1871): This forest fire is often referred to as the deadliest in recorded history. It occurred in Wisconsin, USA, and resulted in the deaths of over 1,500 people</li>
            <li>The Big Burn (1910): This series of wildfires affected several states in the western United States, including Idaho, Montana, and Washington. It led to significant destruction and contributed to the development of wildfire firefighting techniques..</li>
            <li>Black Saturday Bushfires (2009): These devastating bushfires occurred in the state of Victoria, Australia, resulting in numerous fatalities and significant property damage</li>
