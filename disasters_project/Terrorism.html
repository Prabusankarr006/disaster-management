            <h2>Terrorism :</h2>
            <p> Acts of terrorism involve intentional violence or sabotage carried out by individuals or groups with the aim of causing fear, disruption, and harm. Terrorist attacks can include bombings, hijackings, and cyberattacks.

    <h2>Causes :</h2>
    <p> 1.Hardware Issues: Malfunctions or defects in hardware components such as CPUs, memory, hard drives, and power supplies can lead to technology failures.

        <br>2.Software Bugs: Software programs can have coding errors or bugs that cause them to crash or behave unexpectedly.
        
        <br> 3.Network Problems: Issues with network infrastructure, including connectivity problems, bandwidth limitations, or cyberattacks, can disrupt technology systems.
        
        <br>4. Human Error: Mistakes made by individuals, such as incorrect configuration settings, accidental data deletion, or mismanagement of technology resources, can lead to failures.
        
        <br> 5.Power Outages: Sudden power disruptions, surges, or outages can damage hardware components and cause technology failures.
        
        <br>6.Environmental Factors: Extreme temperatures, humidity, dust, or other environmental conditions can impact the functioning of technology equipment.
        
        <br>7.Software Updates: Sometimes, updates or patches to software or firmware can introduce compatibility issues or unintended consequences.
        
        <br>8.Security Breaches: Cyberattacks, malware infections, or data breaches can compromise technology systems and lead to failures.
        
        <br>9.Aging Infrastructure: Outdated or aging technology infrastructure may become unreliable and prone to failures over time.
        
        <br>10.Insufficient Maintenance: Neglecting regular maintenance, including software updates, hardware cleaning, and system monitoring, can result in technology failures.
        
        <br> 11.Vendor or Supplier Issues: Reliance on third-party vendors or suppliers can introduce risks if they experience problems with their products or services.
        
        <br>12.Natural Disasters: Events like earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, or wildfires can physically damage technology infrastructure and disrupt operations.
        
        <br>13.Capacity Limitations: Systems may fail when they reach their maximum capacity, leading to slowdowns or crashes.
        
        <br>14.Interoperability Problems: Incompatibility between different technology components or systems can result in failures when they cannot communicate effectively.
        
        <br>15.Regulatory Compliance: Failure to comply with industry regulations or data protection laws can lead to system failures due to legal or financial repercussions.
