            <h2>Landslides :</h2>
            <p>A landslide is a geological phenomenon characterized by the sudden and rapid movement of a large volume of earth material, such as soil, rocks, and debris, down a slope. Landslides can vary in size and intensity, ranging from small, localized slides to massive, destructive events that can result in significant damage and loss of life.
            </p>
            <h2>Causes :</h2>
            <p>
               <br> 1. Heavy Rainfall: Prolonged or intense rainfall can saturate the soil, reducing its stability and causing it to become more susceptible to sliding.

 <br>2. Steep Slopes:Slopes with steep inclines are more prone to landslides because gravitational forces are more likely to overcome the resistance of the soil or rock.

 <br>3. Earthquakes: Seismic activity can shake the ground, destabilizing slopes and triggering landslides.

            </p>
            <h2>
                Preventions :
            </h2>
            <p>
               <br> 1. Land Use Planning: Proper land use planning and zoning regulations can help restrict development in high-risk landslide areas.

 <br>2. Vegetation and Afforestation: Planting and maintaining vegetation on slopes can help stabilize the soil and reduce erosion.

  <br>3.  Retaining Walls and Slope Stabilization:Building retaining walls and installing slope stabilization measures can help reinforce slopes and prevent landslides.
