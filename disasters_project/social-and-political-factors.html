            <h2>Social and Political Factors :</h2>
            <p>  Man-made disasters can also be caused or exacerbated by social and political factors, such as economic inequality, inadequate disaster preparedness and response, and governanceÂ failures.     
                 </p></section>
<section>
    <h2>Causes :</h2>
    <p>1.Political Instability: Political unrest, conflicts, and wars can lead to manmade disasters such as bombings, chemical spills, or infrastructure destruction.

        <br>2.Poor Governance: Weak or corrupt governance can result in inadequate regulation and oversight of industries, increasing the risk of accidents and environmental pollution.
        
        <br>3.Lack of Regulations: Insufficient or poorly enforced regulations in areas like construction, transportation, and industry can contribute to disasters, such as building collapses or chemical accidents.
        
        <br>4.Resource Allocation: Political decisions on resource allocation can impact disaster preparedness and response. Insufficient funding for emergency services can hinder their ability to mitigate disasters.
        
        <br>5.Social Inequities: Disparities in access to resources and services can make certain populations more vulnerable to disasters. Social inequalities can affect evacuation, access to healthcare, and recovery efforts.
        </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Prevention :</h2>
    <p>Disaster vulnerabilities can be reduced through pre-event activities, such as hazards and vulnerability assessments; land-use regulations; building code development, adoption, and enforcement; warning systems; and education and training programs.</p>
