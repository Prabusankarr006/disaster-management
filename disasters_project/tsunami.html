            <h2>Tsunami :</h2>
            <p>
                A tsunami is a series of large ocean waves generated by a sudden disturbance in the Earth's crust, typically caused by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, or meteorite impacts. These waves can travel across entire ocean basins and inflict significant damage when they reach coastlines. Here's a breakdown of causes and prevention measures
            </p>
            <h2>Causes:</h2>
            <p>
    <br>1.Underwater Earthquakes: The most common cause of tsunamis is underwater earthquakes. When tectonic plates beneath the ocean floor suddenly shift, they can displace a large volume of water, creating a tsunami.

 <br>2. Volcanic Eruptions: Volcanic eruptions, especially those occurring in or near the ocean, can lead to the displacement of water and the formation of tsunamis.

 <br>3. Landslides: Underwater landslides, whether caused by geological factors or human activities like mining, can trigger tsunamis by pushing large volumes of water.

 <br>4. Meteorite Impacts: Rarely, large meteorites striking the ocean can create tsunamis due to the massive energy release and water displacement.

            </p>
            <h2>Prevention:
            </h2>
            <p> <br>1.Early Warning Systems: Developing and maintaining robust tsunami warning systems is crucial. These systems use seismic data to detect underwater earthquakes and issue timely alerts to coastal communities. People should have access to these alerts through various communication channels.

                <br>  2. Evacuation Plans:Coastal communities in tsunami-prone areas should have well-defined evacuation plans. Residents should be educated about the signs of a potential tsunami and how to respond quickly to evacuation orders.
                
                <br> 3. Land-Use Planning: Governments can implement land-use regulations that limit construction in high-risk coastal zones. This helps reduce the potential loss of life and property in the event of a tsunami.
                
                <br>  4. Engineering Solutions: In some cases, engineering solutions like seawalls, breakwaters, and tsunami-resistant buildings can help reduce the impact of tsunamis. However, these solutions are not foolproof and can be costly to implement.

                <h2>History of Tsunami</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Krakatoa Tsunami (Indonesia): In 1883, the eruption of the Krakatoa volcano triggered a massive tsunami in Indonesia, resulting in over 36,000 deaths.</li>
            <li>Messina Tsunami (Italy): In 1908, a powerful earthquake in the Strait of Messina triggered a tsunami, causing significant destruction and approximately 80,000 fatalities.</li>
            <li>Indian Ocean Tsunami (Indian Ocean): On December 26, 2004, a massive undersea earthquake off the coast of Sumatra generated a tsunami that affected multiple countries around the Indian Ocean, leading to more than 230,000 casualties.</li>
            <li>Tohoku Tsunami (Japan): In 2011, a powerful undersea earthquake off the coast of Tohoku, Japan, created a devastating tsunami, resulting in around 16,000 deaths and the Fukushima nuclear disaster.</li>
