            <h2>Hurricans,Typhoons and Cyclones :</h2>
            
            <p>Hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones are all terms used to describe the same weather phenomenon: powerful tropical storms characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, and low-pressure systems. These storms form over warm ocean waters and can cause significant damage when they make landfall. The terminology depends on the region in which they occur:
                <br>
                Hurricane: Used in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean.
                <br> Typhoon: Used in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.
                <br>Cyclone: Used in the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean.
            </p>
            <h2>Causes :</h2>
            <ol>
  <li>Warm Ocean Waters: Hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones form over warm ocean waters, typically when sea surface temperatures are 26°C (79°F) or higher.
  </li>
  <li> Low-Pressure Systems: A disturbance or cluster of thunderstorms can create a low-pressure system over the warm ocean. This low-pressure area serves as the initial stage of storm development.
</li>  
<li>  Coriolis Effect: The rotation of the Earth causes developing storms to spin in a particular direction. In the Northern Hemisphere, they spin counterclockwise, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they spin clockwise.
</li>  
 <li>   Moisture: These storms thrive on moisture and water vapor. As warm, moist air rises from the ocean's surface, it cools and condenses, releasing latent heat and further fueling the storm</li>
  </li>
  
</ol>
<h2>
    Prevention measures :
</h2>
        
       <p>
       
<br>1.Building Codes and Infrastructure: Construction codes in vulnerable areas should be designed to withstand high winds and flooding. Buildings should be elevated, and roofs should be secured. Storm-resistant building materials can also be used.

<br>2.Evacuation Plans: Communities in high-risk areas should have well-organized evacuation plans in place. People should know where to go and how to get there safely.

<br>3.Disaster Preparedness Kits: Individuals and families should have emergency kits with essentials like food, water, first-aid supplies, and flashlights. These kits can sustain them until help arrives.

<br>4.Reforestation and Coastal Protection: Coastal vegetation like mangroves and coral reefs can act as natural barriers, absorbing some of the storm's energy. Reforestation efforts can help reduce erosion and protect coastlines.
<br>5.Climate Change Mitigation: Addressing climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions can help reduce the frequency and intensity of these storms, as warmer ocean temperatures are a key factor in their formation.

<br>6.Public Education: Education campaigns can inform the public about the risks and how to prepare for these storms. Knowledge and awareness are crucial for safety.

<br>7.International Cooperation: Given that these storms can affect multiple countries, international cooperation is essential for effective response and disaster relief efforts
