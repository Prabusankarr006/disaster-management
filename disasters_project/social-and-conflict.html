            <h2>Social and conflict disaster :</h2>
            <p>"Social and conflict disaster" is not a widely recognized term in disaster studies or related fields. However, it seems you might be referring to two separate concepts: "social disaster" and "conflict disaster." Let me explain each of these terms:

            <h2>Social Disaster :</h2>
            <p> A social disaster refers to a situation or event that has widespread negative effects on a society or community. These effects are often related to social and human aspects, such as the disruption of social systems, community cohesion, and the well-being of individuals. Social disasters can result from natural events like earthquakes or hurricanes, as well as human-made events like economic collapses, pandemics, or political upheavals. The key characteristic of a social disaster is the significant disruption of social structures and the well-being of the affected population.

            <h2>Conflict Disaster :</h2>
            <p> A conflict disaster, on the other hand, typically refers to the disastrous consequences of armed conflicts or wars. These disasters often involve extensive violence, displacement of populations, destruction of infrastructure, and severe humanitarian crises. Conflict disasters can result from both international conflicts (wars between nations) and internal conflicts (civil wars, insurgencies). They have a profound impact on the social, economic, and political fabric of the affected regions, leading to widespread suffering and hardship</p>
