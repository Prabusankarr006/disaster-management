            <h2>Tornadoes :</h2>
            <p>Tornadoes are violent and destructive natural phenomena characterized by a rapidly rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. They are often referred to as "twisters" or "cyclones." Tornadoes can cause significant damage to property and pose a serious threat to human life. Here's an overview of tornadoes, their causes, and some measures to prevent or mitigate their impact:
            </p>
            <h2>Causes of Tornadoes :</h2>
            <p>
                Tornadoes are primarily caused by the interaction of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico colliding with cold, dry air from Canada. This clash of air masses sets the stage for severe thunderstorms, and under the right atmospheric conditions, tornadoes can form. The specific causes and conditions that lead to tornado formation include:

 <br>1. Thunderstorms: Tornadoes are most commonly associated with supercell thunderstorms, which have a rotating updraft known as a mesocyclone.

 <br>2. Wind Shear: Wind shear refers to the change in wind speed and direction with altitude. When there is significant wind shear in the atmosphere, it can lead to the development of rotating updrafts within thunderstorms, a crucial factor for tornado formation.

 <br>3. Lifting Mechanisms: Something needs to lift or tilt the rotating air within a supercell thunderstorm to a vertical position. This can be caused by various factors, such as frontal boundaries, drylines, or other storm systems.

 <br>4. Condensation and Rotation: As the air within the thunderstorm rises and condenses, it can lead to the formation of a rotating mesocyclone. Under certain conditions, this rotation can be intensified and stretched into a tornado
            </p>
            <h2>Preventions :</h2>
            <p>
<br>1. Advanced Warning Systems: Meteorological agencies use radar and weather monitoring systems to detect the conditions that may lead to tornado formation. When conditions are favorable, tornado watches and warnings are issued to alert the public, providing precious time for people to seek shelter.

 <br>2. Tornado Preparedness:Individuals and communities in tornado-prone areas should have a well-defined tornado preparedness plan. This includes knowing where to seek shelter (typically a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building) and having an emergency kit with essential supplies.

 <br>3. Building Codes:Building codes in tornado-prone regions should include regulations for constructing tornado-resistant structures. Reinforced safe rooms or storm shelters can significantly reduce the risk to occupants during a tornado.

 <br>4. Public Education: Educating the public about tornado safety and preparedness is crucial. This includes conducting drills, raising awareness, and ensuring that residents know how to respond when tornado warnings are issued.

 <br>5. Early Warning Systems: Communities can invest in sirens and other alert systems that provide audible warnings to residents when tornado warnings are issued.

 <br>6. Storm Chasing and Research:Meteorologists and researchers study tornadoes to better understand their formation and behavior, which can lead to improved forecasting and mitigationÂ strategies.
